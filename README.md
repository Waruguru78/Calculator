# New Things Learned or Refreshed
 I realized is being a JavaScript programmer who codes things from scratch is way more complicated than creating small applications. In other words, it seems the real part of being a programmer is THINKING about what has to occur in your application and then EXECUTING IT IN A LOGICAL MANNER, using all the tools that JavaScript gives you. I actually ‚ù§ the simplicity of this calculator. It doesn't even use and eventListener, per se. It just adds a fixed value to the display input and then evaluates the strings that the input displays. Duh. Anyway, I guess this is what learning how to be a programmer is all about.
